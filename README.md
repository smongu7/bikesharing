## Purpose
In this module, we were given the following scenario: my friend Kate and I went to NYC for a week and loved using Citi bike to reach our various destinations in the city. We decided we'd like to introduce it in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. To do this, we have to analyze the citi bike data in New York to see how we might introduce it sucessfully in Des Moines.
## Results

The visualization above displays how many bikes are checked out per hour of the day.

The visualization above displays how many users are annual subscribers and how many are not subscribers.

The visualization above displays the length of time for which bikes are checked out.

The visiualization above displays the length of time for whick bikes are checked out per gender.

The visualization above displays the most common checkout and check-in times.

The visualization above displays the most common checkout and check-in times by gender per day of the week. From this visualization, we can see that 5:00pm-6:00pm is the peak time for both males and females.

The visualization above displays the peak days of the week by user type and gender.

## Summary
According to the results, male subscribers going on 5-6 minute trips represent the majority of the citi bike users. Additionally, morning rush hour is 8:00am-9:00am while afternoon "rush hour" is about 3:00pm-7:00pm, most commonly being 5:00pm-6:00pm on Thursdays. Thus, I would advise that these may likely be the busiest times for bike usage in Des Moines as well. However, I would recommend creating a visualization for the most common number of miles traveled on a citibike as well as number of miles traveled per hour of each weekday.
